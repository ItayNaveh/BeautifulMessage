Ever wanted to create some code that prints a message but you felt it was too readable?
Then I have a solution to you.

Simply have rust installed and run
```
cargo run msg.txt
```

> (instead of `msg.txt` you can of course use some other file) <br/>

and presto! you have your beautiful code in front of your eyes.
